## Playlists [/playlists]

Playlists are ordered collections of media. They can be dumb (just a list of media) or smart (based on a media query, such as "all albums from 2017"). They can be organized in (optionally nesting) folders.

Retrieving a playlist, or its items, will trigger a refresh of its metadata. This may cause the duration and number of items to change.

### Retrieve Playlists [GET /playlists/all{?playlistType,smart}]

Gets a list of playlists and playlist folders for a user. General filters are permitted, such as `sort=lastViewedAt:desc`. A flat playlist list can be retrieved using `type=15` to limit the collection to just playlists. Special attributes returned are:

- `smart` (0/1) - whether or not the playlist is smart.
- `duration` (milliseconds) - the total duration of the playlist.
- `leafCount` - the number of items in the playlist.
- `composite` - a composite image for the playlist.
- `key` - leads to a list of items in the playlist.
- `playlistType` - the type of the playlist (audio/video/photo).
- `specialPlaylistType` - if this is a special playlist, this returns its type (e.g. favorites).
- `readOnly` - if we return this as true then this playlist cannot be altered or deleted directly by the client.

+   Parameters
    + playlistType: `audio` (string, optional)  - limit to a type of playlist (`audio`, `video` or `photo`)
    + smart: `0` (boolean, optional) - optional, type of playlists to return (default is all).

+   Response 200 (application/xml)

### Create a Playlist [POST /playlists?{title,type,smart,uri,playQueueID}]

Create a new playlist. By default the playlist is blank. To create a playlist along with a first item, pass:

- `uri` - The content URI for what we're playing (e.g. `library://...`).
- `playQueueID` - To create a playlist from an existing play queue.

If you're creating a smart playlist, you must pass `smart=1` and use the `uri=...` form. Playlists are owned by the account associated with the request.

+   Parameters
     + title: `My Playlist` (string) - name of the playlist
     + type: `audio` (string) - type of the playlist (`video`/`audio`/`photo`)
     + smart: `0` (0/1) - whether the playlist is smart or not.
     + uri: `library://..` (string, optional) - the content URI for the playlist.
     + playQueueID: `123` (integer, optional) - the play queue to copy to a playlist.

+   Response 200 (application/xml)

### Retrieve Playlist  [GET /playlists/{playlistID}]

Gets detailed metadata for a playlist. A playlist for many purposes (rating, editing metadata, tagging), can be treated like a regular metadata item:

Smart playlist details contain the `content` attribute. This is the content URI for the generator. This can then be parsed by a client to provide smart playlist editing.

+   Parameters
    + playlistID: `123` (integer) - the ID of the playlist.

+   Response 200 (application/xml)

### Retrieve Playlist Contents [GET /playlists/{playlistID}/items{?type}]

Gets the contents if a playlist. Should be paged by clients via standard mechanisms. By default leaves are returned (e.g. episodes, movies). In order to return other types you can use the `type` parameter. For example, you could use this to display a list of recently added albums vis a smart playlist. Note that for dumb playlists, items have a `playlistItemID` attribute which is used for deleting or moving items.

+   Parameters
    + playlistID: `123` (integer) - the ID of the playlist.
    + type: `8` (integer) - the metadata type of the item to return.

Imports m3u playlists by passing a path on the server to scan for m3u-formatted playlist files, or a path to a single playlist file.

+   Parameters
    + path: `/home/barkley/playlist.m3u` - absolute path to a directory on the server where m3u files are stored, or the absolute path to a playlist file on the server. If the `path` argument is a directory, that path will be scanned for playlist files to be processed. Each file in that directory creates a separate playlist, with a name based on the filename of the file that created it. The GUID of each playlist is based on the filename. If the `path` argument is a file, that file will be used to create a new playlist, with the name based on the filename of the file that created it. The GUID of each playlist is based on the filename.
    + force: `1` - force overwriting of duplicate playlists. By default, a playlist file uploaded with the same path will overwrite the existing playlist. The `force` argument is used to disable overwriting. If the `force` argument is set to 0, a new playlist will be created suffixed with the date and time that the duplicate was uploaded.

+   Response 200
