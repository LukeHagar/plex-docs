### Querying status of updates [GET /updater/status]

- Response 200 (application/xml;charset=utf-8)

  - Body

```xml
            <MediaContainer size="1" canInstall="0" autoUpdateVersion="1" checkedAt="1486011538" downloadURL="https://plex.tv/downloads/..." status="0">

### Checking for updates [PUT /updater/check]

- Parameters

  - download: `0` (bool, optional) - Indicate that you want to start download any updates found.

- Response 200

### Applying updates [PUT /updater/apply{?tonight/skip}]

- Parameters
  - tonight: `1` (bool, optional) - Indicate that you want the update to run during the next Butler execution. Omitting this or setting it to false indicates that the update should install immediately.
  - skip: `0` (bool, optional) - Indicate that the latest version should be marked as skipped. The <Release/> entry for this version will have the `state` set to `skipped`.

Note that these two parameters are effectively mutually exclusive. The `tonight` parameter takes precedence and `skip` will be ignored if `tonight` is also passed.
