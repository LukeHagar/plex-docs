Playlists are ordered collections of media. They can be dumb (just a list of media) or smart (based on a media query, such as "all albums from 2017"). 
They can be organized in (optionally nesting) folders.
Retrieving a playlist, or its items, will trigger a refresh of its metadata. 
This may cause the duration and number of items to change.




```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
