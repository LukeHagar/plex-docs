Howdy everyone!

My Name is Luke,

I've been a big fan of Plex and the Plex Ecosystem for some time now. I started my journey with a simple MacBook with an external hardrive, and I've slowly migrated to a dedicated unraid server with ~90TB of space.

I've been learning a lot in my professional career, and decided to try applying some of it to aid the Plex Developer Community in its pursuits.

So this website is my first attempt at fully open source API documentation for Plex.tv and Plex Media Server.

This [website](https://github.com/LukeHagar/plex-docs) is dynamically generated from an [open source OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/LukeHagar/plex-api-spec), and is rebuilt via github actions and redeployed to vercel everytime that specification is updated.

I have some [legacy format documentation](/docs/legacy) that was very kindly provided to me by the incredible Elan, CTO at Plex. This documentation is what I am currently working on converting to the OpenAPI specification format.

There is still many endpoints, parameters, examples, and schemas missing from the OpenAPI Spec and I invite anyone in the community to contribute anything they can or want towards the documentation or the site.

I hope you find this site useful, and I wish everyone a easier and more pleasing time developing with Plex.

Cheers :)
